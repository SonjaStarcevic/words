# words
Final project at IT Bootcamp.  Extracts words from a text file and compares it to a database dictionary.

The goal is to extract the words from the text file. Words found in the dictionary are to be counted and top 20 words are printed out.
Words that aren't present in the dictionary are supposed to be added into a new table in the database.
Finally, all words that appear in the book are to be written into a separate text file in lexicographical order.
